<p>Fuel consumption (in gasoline equivalent gallons per day) by vehicle type is calculated from the respective estimates of VMT and fuel economy. These estimates are then split into fuel types. The model addresses five fuel types: gasoline, ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), ethanol, biodiesel, and CNG. For each vehicle type, input data specify the fuel proportions by year. These data can be changed for future year scenarios via the parameters menu) to represent various fuels policies and assumptions.</p>
<p>
For light vehicles (automobiles and light trucks), the first step is to allocate fuel consumed between gasoline, CNG, and diesel types. Different proportions are provided for automobiles and light trucks. Fuel for gasoline engines is then split between gasoline, ethanol, and CNG based on input proportions. Similarly, diesel fuel use is split between ULSD and biodiesel. A similar process is used to split heavy truck and bus fuel consumption into fuel types. The report of fuel consumption by place type in RPAT reports just light vehicle fuel consumption.
