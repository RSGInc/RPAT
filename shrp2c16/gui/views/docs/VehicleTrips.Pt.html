<p>The model’s calculations generally work with VMT and not individual trips. The change in the number of vehicle trips is calculated using a set of elasticities from Index 4D Values (2001) (shown below) that pivots from the current number of vehicle trips per capita based on the scenario’s allocation of growth by place type. The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The model reports the additional number of trips caused by the growth assumed in the scenario and not the regional total. </p>
