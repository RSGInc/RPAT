This file contains the distribution of existing (i.e. for the base year) population and employment amongst the 13 place types. Each column must sum to 1. It is acceptable to have no land use (i.e. a value of 0) in certain categories. <br /><br />

The built environment is described by 13 place types as shown below. One emerging school of thought in land use planning is to consider land uses in terms of place types instead of simply residential or commercial or high density compared to low density. A place type refers to all of the characteristics of a developed area including the types of uses included, the mix of uses, the density and intensity of uses. 
</p>
<p>
An initial typology or system to organize place types can be traced to the Smart Growth Transect, which contained six zones in its original configuration including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Rural Preserve</li>
<li>Rural Reserve</li>
<li>Edge</li> 
<li>General</li>
<li>Center</li>
<li>Core</li>
</ul>
<p>
This approach to classifying place types was further refined in the Caltrans Smart Mobility which defined the following seven place types including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Urban Centers</li>
<li>Close-In Compact Communities</li>
<li>Compact Communities</li>
<li>Suburban Communities</li>
<li>Rural and Agricultural Lands</li>
<li>Protected Lands</li>
<li>Special Use Areas</li>
</ul>
<p>
Several of these place type Categories provided additional options such as the Close-In Compact Communities which had three sub-definitions including Close-In-Centers, Close-In Corridors, and Close-In Neighborhoods.</p>
<p>
An alternative view of place types was provided by Reconnecting America, which developed a performance based place type approach for describing areas proximate to transit stations. Station areas would vary in terms of their relative focus between residential units, employees or a mix of the two. Station areas are also characterized on their relative intensity as well as shown below. <br />

<p>
The approach employed for the place types in this study is therefore an amalgam of all of these approaches, in that the terminology is borrowed from the Smart Growth Transect and Caltrans Smart Mobility Study, while the relative performance of each place type is taken from the Reconnecting America approach but applied to a region instead of transit station sites. 
Four general place types were then defined including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Urban Core</b> was determined to be high-density mixed use places with high jobs-housing ratios, well connected streets and high levels of pedestrian activities. It is anticipated that for many regions, the Urban Core will be the traditional downtown area of which they likely would be only one. One a Statewide level, the Urban Cores would be the downtown areas of the major cities, of which there would be a limited number. </li>
<li>The <b>Close in Community</b> would be those areas located near to the Urban Cores and would consist primarily of housing with scattered mixed-use centers and arterial corridors. Housing would be varied in terms of density and type. Transit would be available with a primary focus on commute trips. These areas may be classified by their residents as suburban would be considered to be Close In Communities given their adjacency to the Downtown and therefore the higher levels of regional accessibility. </li>
<li>The <b>Suburban</b> place type is anticipated to represent the majority of development within regions. These communities are characterized by low level of integration of housing with jobs, retail, and services, poorly connected street networks, low levels of transit service, large amounts of surface parking, and limited walk ability. </li>
<li>The <b>Rural</b> place type is defined as settlements of widely spaced towns separated by firms, vineyards, orchards, or grazing lands. These areas would be characterized by widely dispersed residential uses, little or no transit service, and very limited pedestrian facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Further definition of the place types is allowed through the use of sub-categories within the Urban Core, Close in Community, and Suburban place types including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Residential</b> includes all place types that are predominantly residential in character with limited employment and retail opportunities. Examples of this sub-category might include typical Suburban Residential or areas of the Downtown which are primarily residential as well. It is anticipated that this sub-category may be found in all of the place types except for rural. </li>
<li><b>Employment</b> includes those areas which are focused on employment with limited retail and residential. An example of this might include a Suburban Office Complex or a large cluster of office buildings within a Close In Community or Urban Core. As with the residential sub-category, it is anticipated that this type of use would be found in all place types except for rural.</li>
<li><b>Mixed-Use</b> are those areas within a region which have a mix of residential, employment, and retail uses. While this sub-category can be found in the Suburban place type, it is most commonly found in the Close in Community and Urban Core place type. Downtown areas that have retained their residential population to complement the employment are examples of this sub-category.</li>
<li><b>Transit Oriented Development (TOD)</b> which is similar to the other sub-categories, but applied to all place types except for Rural areas since it is thought to be highly unlikely that a rural TOD would be developed. The TOD sub-category is characterized by greater access to transit in all place types. Examples of this sub-category might include a Suburban TOD focused on a commuter rail station.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The process of allocating existing land use to the thirteen place types is somewhat dependent on the types of data available in a region that describe existing land use, and the process can be either very detailed or somewhat simplified. The following description relays the process developed by Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) as part of the pilot testing of RPAT and provides an example of how, mechanically, an agency can approach this allocation. It should be notes that this is merely one approach and not a specific recommendation for a method that should be followed.
</p>
<p>
In general, ARC followed a somewhat detailed process to derive input data from land use data as presented in their “Unified Growth Policy Map”, and from their regional travel demand model. They developed heuristics to align their land use with the 13 place types that RPAT uses. </p>
<p>
The conversion of land use data to the place type scheme used in RPAT involved taking ARC’s Unified Growth Policy Map (UGPM) Areas and converting them to the 13 RPAT place types. </p>
<ul>
<li>The first step was to allocate the UGPM areas to the four area types used in RPAT. The Urban Core area type includes Region Core, Region Employment Centers and Aerotropolis UGPM areas; Close in Community includes Maturing Neighborhoods; Suburban includes Developing Suburbs and Established Suburbs; and Rural includes Rural Areas and Developing Rural.</li>
<li>The ARC traffic analysis zone (TAZ) system was overlaid with the area types and the centroid of the TAZ was used to determine its area type.</li>
<li>The RPAT development type, the other dimension of the place type matrix, which included residential, mixed-use, employment, and TOD development types was determined for each TAZ using the base year percentage of the TAZ’s employment in relation to the total of the population and employment in the TAZ. The mix between the employment and employment was used to determine the TAZs development type using the following cut points:
<ul>
<li>Residential:  < 33.33%</li>
<li>Mixed Use:   33.33 to 66.67%</li>
<li>Employment:  > 66.67%</li>
</ul>
<li>Only one TAZ was determined to be TOD as a development type, Lindbergh Center, in the Urban Core area type.</li>
<li>The combination of the area type and the development type was then used to allocate all TAZs to one of the 13 place types.</li>
<li>The 2010 TAZ employment and population totals were summed by the 13 place type and then scaled to total one for both employment and population as called for by the file format for place_type_existing.csv.
</li></ul>
<p>
The population and employment growth amounts between 2010 and 2040 were determined for the 13 place types and were scaled to total 1 for both employment and population as called for by the file format for place_type_growth.csv.
