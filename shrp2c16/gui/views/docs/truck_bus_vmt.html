<p>This file contains the regionâ€™s proportion of VMT by truck and bus as well as the distribution of that VMT across functional classes (freeway, arterial, other). The file includes one row for Bus VMT data and one row for Truck VMT data. It should be noted that it is <u>not necessary to enter values in the PropVmt column for BusVmt as this is calculated using the values in the transportation_supply.csv input file.</u></p>
<p>The truck VMT proportion (PropVMT column, TruckVMT row) can be obtained from Highway Performance Monitoring System (<a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms.cfm" target="_new">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms.cfm</a>) data and local sources or the regional travel demand model if one exists.</p>
<p>The proportions of VMT by functional class can be derived from the Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study and data from transit operators. The Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study (Table II-6, 1997 Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study Final Report, Chapter II, <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/hcas/final/two.htm" target="_new" >http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/hcas/final/two.htm</a>) is used to calculate the average proportion of truck VMT by functional class. Data from transit authorities are used to calculate the proportions of bus VMT by urban area functional class. </p>
