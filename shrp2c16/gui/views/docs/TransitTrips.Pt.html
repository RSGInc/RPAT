<p>The change in the number of transit trips is calculated using a set of elasticities from Index 4D Values (2001) (shown below) that pivots from the current number of transit trips per capita based on the scenarioâ€™s allocation of growth by place type. The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The model reports the additional number of trips caused by the growth assumed in the scenario and not the regional total.</p>
