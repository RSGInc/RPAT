<p>This file contains population estimates/forecasts by county and age cohort for each of the base and future years. The file format includes six age categories used by the population synthesis model: </p>
<ul>
<li>0 -14</li>
<li>15 – 19</li>
<li>20 – 29</li>
<li>30 – 54</li>
<li>55 – 64</li>
<li>65 Plus</li>
</ul>
<p>
Future year data must be developed by the user; in many regions population forecasts are available from regional or state agencies and/or local academic sources. As with the employment data inputs the future data need not be county specific. Rather, regional totals by age group can be entered into the file with a value such as “region” entered in the county field. </p>
