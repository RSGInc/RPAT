<p>This file is a table of the allocated growth between the base and the future years in population and employment to each of the 13 place types. Each column must sum to one (1). It is acceptable to have no land use growth (i.e., a value of 0) in certain categories. The discussion of the population and jobs by place type input above describes how to allocate existing land use to the 13 place types. A similar approach can be used to allocate expected growth from spatial planning resources such as TAZ or Census Block Group level forecasts to the place types.</p>
