<p>The fuel parameters allocate vehicle miles traveled for each of the four road vehicle types that RPAT represents – auto, light truck, bus, and heavy truck (truck) – to different fuel types. The remaining proportion of fuel not accounted for in these categories is assumed to be gasoline:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>PropDiesel</b>: The proportion of the fleet that uses diesel.</li>
<li><b>PropCng</b>: The proportion of the fleet that uses compressed natural gas.</li>
<li><b>GasPropEth</b>: The average ethanol proportion in gasoline sold.</li>
<li><b>DieselPropBio</b>: The average biodiesel proportion in diesel sold.</li>
</ul>
