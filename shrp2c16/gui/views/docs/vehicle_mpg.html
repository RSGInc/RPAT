<p>Vehicle_mpg.csv contains estimates and forecasts of average fuel economy and power economy in miles per gallon for autos, light trucks, heavy trucks (trucks) and miles per kilowatt for trains by vehicle model year. Note that this is not the fleet average for that year. It is the average for new vehicles sold in that year. The fuel economy is the same for all fuel types and is measured in gasoline equivalent gallons (i.e. energy content of a gallon of gasoline). This file is used in the calculations of fuel consumption. This file can be used to test alternative vehicle development scenarios, such as improved technology and/or fuel economy standards that lead to higher vehicle fuel economies. </p>
