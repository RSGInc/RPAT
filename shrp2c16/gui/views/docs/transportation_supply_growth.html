<p>This file contains four values that allow the user to change the transportation supply in the region in the future year. </p>
<p><b>Freeway</b> –is the percent increase in road lane miles including freeways, arterials and other facilities. By default, the transportation supply is assumed to grow in line with population increase; therefore a value of 1 indicates growth in proportion with population growth. A value less than 1 indicates that there will be less freeway lane mile supply, per person, in the future. A value of 1 indicates faster freeway expansion than population growth.</p>
<p><b>Arterial</b>  - is a similar value to freeway except that it measures arterial lane mile growth. It is also proportional to population growth.</p>
<p>
<b>Bus</b> – is the percent increase in transit revenue miles per capita for bus. It behaves in a similar way to the freeway and rail values in that a value of 1 indicates per capita revenue miles stays constant.</p>
<p><b>Rail</b> - is the percent increase in transit revenue miles per capita for rail. This encompasses all rail modes, from light rail through to commuter rail.</p>
