<ul>
<li><b>AnnVmtInflator</b>: factor to convert vehicle miles traveled between annual and average daily amounts. </li>
<li><b>BaseCostPerMile</b>: base cost per mile in dollars for transportation costs used in the travel demand model to initially represent travel as close to unconstrained by transportation costs. The transportation costs are then fully constrained later in the model as travel reductions caused by budget constraints are estimated.</li>
<li><b>BaseYear</b>: Base year for the model. This should be set by the model user to be consistent with the base year for their input data.</li>
<li><b>BudgetProp</b>: the proportion of household budget that can be allocated to transportation spending. The travel demand models includes a constraint that reduces household travel if too high a proportion of household spending is spent on transportation. See “Travel Demand Models” section of Appendix B, SHRP 2 C16 report).</li>
<li><b>FuelCost</b>: Average cost per gallon of fuel (before taxes are added).</li>
<li><b>FutureYear</b>: Future year for the model. This should be set by the model user to be consistent with the future year for their input data.</li>
<li><b>GasTax</b>: Average cost per gallon of fuel of gas taxes.</li>
<li><b>HhDvmtToRoadDvmt</b>: factor to account for some proportion of a household’s vehicle miles traveled taking place outside of the metro area.</li>
<li><b>LtTruckProp</b>: proportion of household vehicles that are light trucks (SUVs, pickup trucks) as opposed to autos.</li>
<li><b>MjPerGallon</b>: Energy content of a gallon of fuel in mega Joules per gallon.</li>
<li><b>PoundToKilogram</b>: Conversion rate between pounds and kilograms.</li>
<li><b>TranAdjFactor</b>: Factor to convert transit revenue miles (i.e., miles run in service on routes) to total transit vehicle miles operated to account for vehicle miles run while deadheading from depots to route endpoints.</li>
<li><b>TruckVmtGrowthMultiplier</b>: Rate at which heavy truck vehicle miles traveled growth in relation to total regional household income growth in the region. A value of 1 indicates that heavy truck vehicle miles traveled grows at the same rate as total regional household income. A value less than 1 means slower growth in truck vehicle miles traveled, and greater than 1 means faster growth in truck vehicle miles traveled than total regional household income.</li>
<li><b>WorkVmtProp</b>: the proportion of household vehicle miles travelled that takes place for commute to work purposes; used to differentiate between travel purposes for use in estimating overall vehicle miles traveled reductions that are targeted at the commute to work.</li>
<li><b>State</b>: the model state</li>
</ul>
