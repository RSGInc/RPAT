<p>The performance measure for land market and location impacts is related to the regional accessibility calculations, embodied in the analysis of place types. The estimation of VMT by place types includes one variable related to regional accessibility which is jobs accessibility by auto. Job accessibility by auto would be highest in the urban core area and relatively lower in the other place types. The lowest job accessibility by auto would occur in the rural place types. </p>
<p>It is anticipated that the job accessibility by auto would vary based on the amount of new growth allocated to the various place types. If a majority of the new growth is allocated to the rural and suburban place types, it is anticipated that there would be limited growth in jobs accessibility by auto. Otherwise, if a majority of the new growth is allocated to the close in community and urban core place types, then there will be more growth in this measure. </p>
<p>
RPAT reports the relative increase in jobs accessibility in auto based on the existing scenario. This relative increase is a function of the distribution of growth between the four place types, weighted by the population and employment growth in each of the place types.
