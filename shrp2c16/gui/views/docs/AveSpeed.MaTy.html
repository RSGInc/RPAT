<p>The congestion component of the model is used to produce both travel speeds by vehicle type and the vehicle hours of travel and delay. VMT for each of light vehicles, heavy trucks, and buses, is assigned to speeds bins for the three facility types that the model considers â€“ freeways, arterials and other roads. Speed distributions, in terms of the amount of VMT that occurs within each speed bin, are used to derive average speeds.</p>
