<p>Once fuel consumption is split into the five types (measured in gasoline equivalent gallons per day), CO2 equivalents of emissions can be calculated in a straightforward manner. The energy value of the fuel consumed by type is calculated by multiplying by the energy value of a gallon of gasoline. Then the CO2 equivalent (CO2e) daily emissions are calculated by applying the appropriate carbon intensities (grams CO2e per mega joule) of each fuel type. Values reflect “pump-to-wheels” emission rates, representing just the tailpipe emissions and do not include the “well-to-pump” emissions resulting from the production and transportation of fuels. The values included as parameters in the model are shown below. The values are derived from the MOVES 2010a database (the fuel sub type table provides carbon contents and oxidation factors) and from Emission Facts: Greenhouse Gas Emissions from a Typical Passenger Vehicle (U.S. EPA, 2011) to convert to CO2 equivalents (which includes the global warming potential of other gases emitted by vehicles such as CH4, N2O, and HFCs). </p>

All of the light vehicle calculations of fuels and emissions are done at the disaggregate level of households. This allows emissions to be aggregated to place type and along other dimensions. The report of greenhouse gas emissions by place type in RPAT reports just light vehicle fuel consumption. Heavy truck and transit emissions are calculated at the regional level.
