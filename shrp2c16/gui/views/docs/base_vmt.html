This file contains information on total light vehicle VMT and the split by functional class for light vehicles for the base year. </p>
<p>
<b>LtVehDvmt</b> – is light vehicle daily VMT in unit of thousands of miles.
</p>
<p>
<b>FwyArtProp</b> – is the proportions of daily VMT for light vehicles that takes place on freeways and arterials (i.e. the remainder of VMT takes place on lower functional class roads.</p>
<p>
These data can be derived from a combination of Highway Performance Monitoring System (<a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms.cfm">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms.cfm</a>) data, Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study data, and regional data. Light vehicle daily VMT can be estimated by subtracting truck and bus VMT from total VMT provided in the HPMS. The proportions of light vehicle daily VMT on freeways and arterials can be derived from the HPMS data.
