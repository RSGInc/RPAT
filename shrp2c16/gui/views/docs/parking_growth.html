<p>This file contains information that allows the effects of policies such as workplace parking charges and “cash-out buy-back” programs to be tested. The input parameters are as follows and should be entered for both the base and future year:</p>
<p><b>PropWrkPkg</b> – proportion of employees that park at work.</p>
<p><b>PropWrkChrgd</b> – proportion of employers that charge for parking.</p>
<p><b>PropCashOut</b> – proportion of employment parking that is converted from being free to pay under a “cash-out buy-back” type of program.</p>
<p><b>PrkOthChrgd</b> – proportion of other parking that is not free.</p>
<p><b>PkgCost</b> – average daily parking cost. This variable is the average daily parking cost for those who incur a fee to park. If the paid parking varies across the region, then the “PkgCost” value should reflect the average of those parking fees, but weighted by the supply – so if most in the Center City, then the average will be heavily weighted towards the price in the Center City.</p>
