<p>The place_type_elasticites.csv and place_type_relative_values.csv parameter files are used to calculate the effect of land use on various performance metrics relative to a regionally average location. </p>
<p>
The place_type_relative_values.csv contains the D values, which are proportional values for each of the 13 place types that are relative to a regional average, for each of the five Ds used in RPAT - design (intersection street density), accessibility (job accessibility by auto), distance to transit (nearest transit stop), density (population density) and diversity (land use mix).
