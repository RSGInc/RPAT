<p>The emissions rate parameters file contains information on “pump-to-wheels” CO2 equivalent emissions by fuel type in grams per mega Joule of fuel energy content. There is one row for each fuel type: ULSD, biodiesel, RFG (reformulated gasoline), CARBOB (gasoline formulated to be blended with ethanol), ethanol, and CNG. This file is used to convert fuel use to CO2 equivalent emissions.</p>
