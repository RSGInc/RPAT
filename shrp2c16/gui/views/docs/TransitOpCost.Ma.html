<p>The source for transit capital and operating costs is the National Transit Database (NTD, which is available online at http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/), and in particular the National Transit Profile which is available on the NTDB website. The most recent statistics published are for 2009, so CPI adjustments may be necessary if more current data are not available to the user at the time. Costs are available in a variety of index formats, e.g., cost per revenue mile or hour, though cost per passenger trip appears to be the most relevant association with estimation of future transit service needs. </p>

Costs are presented for each mode, since the capital, operating and revenue profiles are quite different for each. It is interesting to note that the comparative cost per trip of bus and heavy rail, while commuter rail and light rail are both considerably -- almost four times -- higher.
