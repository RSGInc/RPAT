Road safety impacts are calculated by factoring the amount of VMT. Daily VMT is converted to annual VMT and then to units of 100 million miles traveled. The following national average rates, from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System General Estimates System (2009) by US Department of Transportation, are then applied to calculate the number of fatal and injury accidents and the value of property damage:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fatal</b>: 1.14 per 100 Million Miles Traveled</li>
<li><b>Injury</b>: 51.35 per 100 Million Miles Traveled</li>
<li><b>Property damage</b>: 133.95 per 100 Million Miles Traveled </li>
</ul>
