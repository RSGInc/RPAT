<p>The percentage change in the amount of walking is calculated by applying a set of elasticities developed in their 4D Meta Analysis by Cervero and Ewing (shown below). The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The product of the elasticity and D value is applied to the place type growth quantities for the scenario to calculated the percentage increase or decrease in walking for new residents in the region relative to a the current place type distribution. </p>
