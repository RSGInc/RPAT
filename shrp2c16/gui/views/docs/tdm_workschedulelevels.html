<p>tdm_workschedule.csv and tdm_workschedulelevels.csv are parameters that describe the effectiveness for different participation levels for three different telecommuting or alternative work schedules.</p>
<p>
The telecommuting or alternative work schedule model first evaluates the likely level of participation throughout the region in terms of telecommuting or alternatively-works schedules. Monte Carlo processes are used to identify which households participate in telecommuting programs. The proportion of employees participating in this program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. The model then determines the type of programs that might be implemented. Three potential alternatives are offered including:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>4/40 Schedule</b>: 4 days per week with 40 hours per week.</li>
<li><b>9/80 Schedule</b>: working 4 days every other week with an average of 80 hours over 2 weeks.</li>
<li><b>Telecommuting</b>: Workers may work 1 to 2 days a week remotely.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once the option has been identified and the level of participation, the estimated VMT is determined on the basis of the parameters in tdm_workschedule.csv.
</p>
<p>
The participation levels in tdm_workschedule.csv correspond to the values in tdm_workschedulelevels.csv, which describe the proportion of employees participating in the program.
