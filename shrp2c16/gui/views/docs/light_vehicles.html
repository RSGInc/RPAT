<p>This file contains input data for the non-motorized vehicle model. In RPAT, non-motorized vehicles are bicycles, and also electric bicycles, Segways, and similar vehicles that are small, light-weight and can travel at bicycle speeds or slightly higher. The parameters are as follows:</p>
<p><b>TargetProp</b> – non-motorized vehicle ownership rate (average ratio of non-motorized vehicles to driver age population).</p>
<p><b>Threshold</b> – SOV tour mileage threshold used in the SOV travel proportion model. This is the upper limit for tour lengths that are suitable for reallocation to non-motorized modes.</p>
<p><b>PropSuitable</b> – proportion of SOV travel suitable for non-motorized vehicle travel. This variable describes the proportion of SOV tours within the mileage threshold for which non-motorized vehicles might be substituted. This variable takes into account such factors as weather and trip purpose.</p>
<p>The non-motorized vehicle model predicts the ownership and use of non-motorized vehicles (where non-motorized vehicles are bicycles, and also electric bicycles, Segways and similar vehicles that are small, light-weight and can travel at bicycle speeds or slightly higher than bicycle speeds). The core concept of the model is that non-motorized vehicle usage will primarily be a substitute for short-distance single-occupant vehicle (SOV) travel. Therefore, the model estimates the proportion of the household vehicle travel that occurs in short-distance SOV tours. The model determines the maximum potential for household VMT to be diverted to non-motorized vehicles, which is also dependent on the availability of non-motorized vehicles. </p>
<p>Note that bike share programs (BSP) serve to increase the availability of non-motorized vehicles and can be taken into account by increasing the “TargetProp” variable. Use national estimates of non-motorized ownership if regional estimates of non-motorized ownership are not available (unless the region has notably atypical levels of bicycle usage).
